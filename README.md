Tool for taking the .jsons made from Dreamstate Echoes and collating them into Dynamo Triad framework– yielding a .json deployment package for AI

Triad Forge (Prestige Edition) - The Assembly Line

Alright, you got your parsed JSON "planks" from DreamParserMax? Good. This is where we build the whole damn house – or rather, the full Dynamo Triad .json deployment package.

So, after messing around with DreamParserMax to get all those squiggly Echoes into nice, orderly JSON, you're left with a pile of digital lumber. That's cool, but a pile of lumber isn't a house. That's where Triad Forge (Prestige Edition) comes in.

Think of this as my workshop's main assembly area. We're not just parsing here; we're forging. We're taking those individual JSON components – your Core Units, Expansion Units, Memory Units, whatever you've got – and bolting 'em all together into one big, beautiful, ready-to-deploy Dynamo Triad package. This isn't just about throwing files together; it's about making them sing as a unified whole.

And yeah, "Prestige Edition" because it's got a few more bells and whistles than my basic "glue it together with duct tape" version. It's for when you want the whole deployment to look slick, even if it was put together by a guy who usually smells like sawdust.
What This Beast Does

This is where the individual pieces become a full-fledged deployment.

    Assembles the Dynamo Triad: Takes all your carefully parsed Echo JSONs and combines them into a single, cohesive deployment package. It's the grand finale for getting Riley's whole setup ready.
    Unit Integration: Got Core Units? Expansion Units? Memory Units? This forge brings 'em all together, making sure they're talking to each other right.
    State Management (Because I Forget Stuff): Lets you save and load your current Triad assembly state. Super handy when you're halfway through building and the real world calls.
    Deploys the Package: The ultimate goal is to export that compiled .json package, ready for whatever platform or system the Dynamo Triad lives on. It's the equivalent of handing over the keys to the finished project.
    Prestige Mode: Means it's got some extra polish and maybe a few more tools to make the compilation process smoother. It's not just functional; it's got a bit of flair.

My "Construction Site" (aka How I Built It)

This tool is the culmination of figuring out how to make all those individual Dreamstate Echo pieces not just exist, but work together as a system. It's a lot like putting together a complex cabinet – every joint has to be tight, every piece in its right place, so the whole thing holds up. And trust me, I've had plenty of digital splinters figuring out those JSON connections.
